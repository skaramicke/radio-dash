# Radio Dashboard - Test Suite Documentation

## Overview
This project now includes a comprehensive test suite built with Jest and React Testing Library that can catch issues early in development without needing to restart the dev server repeatedly.

## Test Coverage

### 🏠 Page Component Tests (`__tests__/app/page.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Renders without crashing
- ✅ Displays correct content
- ✅ Shows loading state
- ✅ Has proper CSS classes
- ✅ Catches console errors

### 📡 ConnectionStatus Component Tests (`__tests__/components/ConnectionStatus.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Connected/disconnected states
- ✅ Station info display
- ✅ Frequency formatting (MHz/kHz)
- ✅ Proper styling and animations
- ✅ Edge cases (zero frequency, null data)
- ✅ Console error detection

### 💬 MessageComponent Tests (`__tests__/components/MessageComponent.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Incoming/outgoing message styling
- ✅ Timestamp formatting
- ✅ SNR display (positive/negative/missing)
- ✅ Multiline text handling
- ✅ Own message vs other message display
- ✅ Console error detection

### 🗄️ Database Tests (`__tests__/lib/database.test.ts`)
- ✅ Database initialization
- ✅ Directory creation
- ✅ Method availability
- ✅ Error handling

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

### Run Tests in Watch Mode (Recommended for Development)
\`\`\`bash
npm run test:watch
\`\`\`

### Run Specific Test File
\`\`\`bash
npm test -- --testPathPatterns=ConnectionStatus.test.tsx
\`\`\`

### Run Tests with Coverage
\`\`\`bash
npm run test:coverage
\`\`\`

## Console Error Detection

The test suite is configured to catch and fail on console errors that would appear in the browser console. This includes:

- React component errors
- Invalid JSX syntax
- Missing dependencies
- Type errors that slip through TypeScript compilation
- Runtime errors

### How It Works
The `jest.setup.js` file mocks `console.error` and `console.warn` to throw errors when unexpected messages appear, effectively failing tests when issues would normally only show in browser dev tools.

## Development Workflow

1. **Write/Modify Components**: Make changes to React components
2. **Run Tests**: Use `npm run test:watch` to automatically run tests as you code
3. **Fix Issues**: Tests will catch problems immediately without needing browser refresh
4. **Verify in Browser**: Once tests pass, check the actual UI in development server

## Key Benefits

- ⚡ **Fast Feedback**: Catch issues instantly without dev server restarts
- 🔍 **Console Error Detection**: Surface runtime errors that might be missed
- 🧪 **Component Isolation**: Test individual components without full app complexity
- ✅ **Regression Prevention**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- 📝 **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of component behavior

## Issue Resolution Example

**Problem**: "The default export is not a React Component" error prevented dev server from loading

**How Tests Helped**:
1. Import test revealed the page component was returning an empty object `{}`
2. File system test showed the `page.tsx` file was 0 bytes (empty)
3. Fixed by properly recreating the component file
4. Tests confirmed the fix before starting dev server

This saved significant debugging time and provided clear diagnostic information.

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Add More Component Tests**: Create tests for `ConversationList.tsx` and `ChatApp.tsx`
2. **API Route Tests**: Test the `/api/events` and `/api/send` endpoints
3. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and data flow
4. **E2E Tests**: Consider Playwright or Cypress for full user journey testing

The test suite is now the primary development tool for catching issues early and ensuring code quality.
